*   `Spectral` and `Orbitron` fonts for a blend of classic serif and futuristic unease.
*   CSS-generated "rough borders" and "hatch backgrounds" to simulate pencil strokes and aged paper.
*   Subtle SVG filters for "wobble" and "shade texture" effects, enhancing the hand-drawn feel.
*   A color palette of muted grays, off-whites, and dark accents (`--pencil-dark-gray`, `--paper-bg`).

This application is crafted with modern web technologies:

*   **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, Custom CSS for thematic effects
